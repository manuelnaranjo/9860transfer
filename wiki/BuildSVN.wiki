This code so far depends on only one library: [http://libusb.sourceforge.net/ libusb] we are using version 0.1.12 check your distribution package manager to get it installed you will also need to install libusb-devel (or how ever it's called in your distro). Gcc or another C compiler, and of course an 9860 to test the soft ;).

You will also need an svn client.
